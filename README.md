# Hashing-Algorithm
A Hash Function (H) takes a variable-length block of data and returns a hash value of a fixed size. A good hash function has a property that when it is applied to a large number of inputs, the outputs will be evenly distributed and appear random. Generally, the primary purpose of a hash function is to maintain data integrity. Any change to any bits or bits in the results will result in a change in the hash code, with a high probability.

The type of hash function that is needed for security purposes is called a cryptographic hash function.

A cryptographic hash function (or cryptographic hash algorithm) is an algorithm that is not computationally efficient (no attack is more efficient than brute force) when it is used to find either:

1-A data object which maps to a predefined hash result
2-Two data objects that map to the hash result in collision-free property.
Because of these properties, a hash function is often used to check whether data has changed.
